        This strawberry crepe recipe has been a family favorite for over 30 years! These crepes are delicious and very rich! Be sure you have at least 1 hour to prepare them; they are worth every minute!
        <h2>What is a Crepe</h2>
        <p>Crepes are French-style pancakes that are thin and flat, and can be made and filled with sweet or savory ingredients.
            We love them filled with nutella and strawberries or bananas, or a sweet cream filling with fruit, like in this recipe.
            If you’re wanting to make them even more elegant, try these Blintzes.
        </p>
        <p>If you want a savory crepe you can leave out the vanilla and some of the sugar and fill them with a creamy chicken mixture or even eggs and ham for a breakfast crepe.</p>
        <p>Crepes are different from American pancakes because they don’t have a rising agent in them (like baking soda or baking powder) so they turn out wafer thin and delicate, rather than thick and fluffy.</p>
